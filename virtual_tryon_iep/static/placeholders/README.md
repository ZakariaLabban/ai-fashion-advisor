# Placeholder Images

This directory contains placeholder images for the virtual try-on service:

1. `model_placeholder.jpg` - A sample person/model image for try-on demonstrations
2. `garment_placeholder.jpg` - A sample garment image (like a t-shirt) for try-on demonstrations
3. `result_placeholder.jpg` - A sample result showing what a try-on might look like

## Instructions for Good Placeholder Images

### Model Images
- Use full-body photos with the person standing in a neutral pose
- Use a solid, contrasting background for best results
- The person should wear simple, solid-colored clothing
- Resolution should be at least 512x768 pixels

### Garment Images
- Use product-style images with the garment against a white/transparent background
- The garment should be centered and take up most of the frame
- For tops: show the entire garment from collar to hem
- For bottoms: show the entire garment from waist to hem
- Resolution should be at least 512x512 pixels

After placing your images here, they will be available as reference for the try-on service.
