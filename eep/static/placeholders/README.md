# Placeholder Images for Fashion Analysis

This directory contains placeholder images for the fashion analysis service:

1. `clothing_placeholder.jpg` - A sample clothing image for analysis demonstrations
2. `outfit_placeholder.jpg` - A sample outfit image for multi-item analysis
3. `annotated_placeholder.jpg` - A sample annotated result showing detection bounding boxes

## Instructions for Good Test Images

### Clothing Images
- Use clear, well-lit photos of clothing items
- Preferably against a plain background for better detection
- Include various clothing types (shirts, pants, shoes, etc.)
- Resolution should be at least 512x512 pixels

### Outfit Images
- Use full-body photos with multiple visible clothing items
- Use good lighting conditions
- Include a variety of clothing styles and items
- Resolution should be at least 512x768 pixels

These placeholder images will be kept in Git to provide examples for testing and demonstration purposes.

Note: Any images uploaded by users will be stored in the `uploads` directory and are excluded from version control.
